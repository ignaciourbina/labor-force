# State Foreign Share Pipeline

This document describes how the percentage of foreign-born workers in each state's labor force is computed and prepared for the API.

## Inputs
1. `data_tables/cps_state_labor_force_totals.csv` â€“ labor-force totals by state with native and foreign-born counts.

## Method
1. Read the CSV file.
2. Compute `foreign_pct` as `(foreign / total_lf) * 100`, rounded to two decimals.
3. Write `API_database_laborforce/data_state_foreign.json` containing records:
   `{ "state": "CA", "state_name": "California", "foreign_pct": 32.48 }`.

## Usage
Run the pipeline with:
```bash
python scripts/state_foreign_share.py
```
